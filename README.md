## Executive Summary

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive and user-friendly web page to explore and visualize a US accident dataset (2016-2023). The dashboard aims to uncover key insights and patterns related to accidents, including their severity and the influence of various factors such as location, time, and weather conditions.

### Target Users

The primary users of this dashboard include policymakers, researchers, traffic safety analysts, and the general public. These users can leverage the dashboard to understand accident trends, improve road safety measures, and make data-driven decisions.

### Unique Value Proposition

This dashboard stands out by offering a comprehensive and intuitive platform for analyzing US accident data. It combines various features such as data quality visualization, feature engineering, preprocessing, and both general and inferential visualizations. These tools enable users to gain deeper insights into accident data, making it a valuable resource for improving traffic safety and informing policy decisions.

## Introduction

### Connecting Our Dashboard to Users

Our US Accidents Dashboard is designed to bridge the gap between complex data and user-friendly analysis. By offering an interactive and intuitive platform, we enable users to easily explore and understand accident data. We have deployed our project using Streamlit Cloud, making it easily accessible to users anytime, anywhere, without the need for complex installations or configurations.

### Motivation and Purpose

The motivation behind this project is to leverage data to improve road safety. With thousands of accidents occurring every day, understanding the factors that contribute to these incidents is crucial. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a tool that helps users identify trends, analyze patterns, and ultimately contribute to reducing accidents on the roads.

### Filling the Market Void

Currently, there is a lack of accessible, comprehensive tools for analyzing US accident data. Many existing solutions are either too complex for the average user or too simplistic to provide meaningful insights. Our dashboard fills this void by combining ease of use with powerful analytical capabilities, offering a unique solution that meets the needs of a wide range of users.

### Main Objectives

The main objectives of our dashboard are:
- To provide an interactive platform for exploring US accident data.
- To visualize data quality, including missing values and outliers.
- To prepare data for exploration by normalizing, binning, and sampling.
- To enable detailed analysis of accident factors such as location, time, and weather.
- To filter the data for analysis.
- To support feature engineering and data preprocessing for deeper insights.
- To offer both general and inferential visualizations to help users draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
- To develop visually appealing and informative data visualizations.
- To design and evaluate color palettes for visualization based on principles of perception, enhancing readability and interpretability.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the "US-Accidents: A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset," which covers 49 states of the United States from February 2016 to 2023. The data is continuously collected from multiple sources, including APIs that provide streaming traffic event data. The dataset includes approximately 0.5 million accident records with 46 columns detailing various aspects of each accident.

### Key Columns

- **ID**: Unique identifier of the accident record.
- **Severity**: Severity of the accident (1 to 4).
- **Start_Time**: Start time of the accident.
- **End_Time**: End time of the accident.
- **Start_Lat**: Latitude of the start point.
- **Start_Lng**: Longitude of the start point.
- **End_Lat**: Latitude of the end point.
- **End_Lng**: Longitude of the end point.
- **Distance(mi)**: Length of the road affected by the accident.
- **Description**: Natural language description of the accident.
- **City**: City where the accident occurred.
- **State**: State where the accident occurred.
- **Weather_Condition**: Weather condition during the accident (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc.).
- **Temperature(F)**: Temperature at the time of the accident.
- **Visibility(mi)**: Visibility at the time of the accident.
- **Wind_Speed(mph)**: Wind speed at the time of the accident.
- **Precipitation(in)**: Precipitation amount at the time of the accident.

## Plots

### Heatmap for Missing Values
A heatmap visually represents missing data in a dataset, highlighting the presence and pattern of missing values across different features.

### Pie Chart
A pie chart displays data as slices of a circle, showing the relative proportions of different categories within a dataset.

### Bar Plot
A bar plot uses rectangular bars to represent and compare the frequency or value of different categories.

### Violin Plot for Outliers
A violin plot combines a box plot with a kernel density plot, showing the distribution, probability density, and presence of outliers in the data.

### Box Plot for Outliers
A box plot summarizes the distribution of a dataset, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

### Histogram for Data Distribution
A histogram displays the frequency distribution of a dataset by grouping data into bins and showing the count of data points in each bin.

### Quantile-Quantile Plot for Normalization Visualization
A quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot compares the quantiles of a dataset to the quantiles of a theoretical distribution, helping to assess if the data follows the desired distribution.

### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot displays individual data points on a two-dimensional plane, showing the relationship between two numerical variables.

### Line Plot
A line plot connects data points with lines, typically used to show trends over time or the relationship between two continuous variables.

### Rose Plot
A rose plot (circular bar plot or wind rose) displays data in circular segments, often used to represent cyclic data like wind direction and speed.

### Folium Map to Visualize US Accident Places
A Folium map uses the Folium library to create interactive maps, plotting locations of accidents across the United States for geographical analysis.
